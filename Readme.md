# HTMX

HTMX is a powerful library that allows you to access AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes. It enables you to build modern, dynamic web applications with minimal JavaScript.

## Features

- **AJAX**: Load content asynchronously without a full page reload.
- **CSS Transitions**: Apply smooth transitions to your elements.
- **WebSockets**: Enable real-time communication between the client and server.
- **Server-Sent Events**: Receive updates from the server in real-time.

## Installation

You can include HTMX in your project by adding the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.6.1"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install htmx.org
```

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use HTMX to load content via AJAX:

```html
<button hx-get="/content" hx-target="#result">Load Content</button>
<div id="result"></div>
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, HTMX will make an AJAX request to `/content` and load the response into the `#result` div.
